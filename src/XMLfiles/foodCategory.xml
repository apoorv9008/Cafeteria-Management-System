During strawberry season, I like to serve chocolate strawberries are served as a finale to dinner, as decorations for cakes, and at my family's annual Mother's Day Afternoon Tea. Try serving chocolate strawberries with champagne or your favorite red wine. Since we grow pinot noir grapes, I naturally like to serve pinot noir wine.
